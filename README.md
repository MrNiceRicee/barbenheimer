# BarbenHeimer Voting
Vote between the two movies Barbie and Oppenheimer. They're both releasing on the same day, and thought it would be funny to make a voting app based on the United States of America's voting system.

Just some silly app to learn more about NextJs. I'm not too familiar with it, so decided to make this to learn more about it.
This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.


If you see something that should be updated or added send a PR :)
